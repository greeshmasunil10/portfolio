          I am a computer science master with a passion for coding and creating.
          I've got a solid background in various programming languages like
          Java, Python, and JavaScript, and I've honed my skills through
          hands-on experience working with a range of cutting-edge technologies.
          <p />
          But I'm more than just a code monkey. I'm a problem solver at heart,
          always seeking out new and innovative ways to improve the lives of my clients 
          and make a positive impact.
