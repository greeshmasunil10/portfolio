          I am a computer science master with a passion for coding and creating.
          With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js, I have
          honed my skills through hands-on experience working with a range of cutting-edge technologies.
          <p />
          But I'm more than just a code monkey. I'm a problem solver at heart,
          always seeking out new and innovative ways to improve the lives of my clients 
          and make a positive impact.
